- [ ] **Competition Metrics**: Show participation stats, deadlines, prizes

### Phase 3: Model Lists  
- [ ] **Model Discovery**: List available models and frameworks
- [ ] **Model Filtering**: Filter by framework, task type, performance metrics
- [ ] **Model Versions**: Track different versions of models
- [ ] **Popular Models**: Highlight trending and highly-rated models
- [ ] **User Models**: List models by specific users

### Phase 4: Kernel/Notebook Lists

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints
- Implement consistent pagination across all list types
- Add caching layer for frequently accessed lists
- Support bulk operations for multiple list requests

### CLI Enhancements
- Interactive filtering and sorting in CLI
- Export capabilities (CSV, JSON, XML)
- Bookmarking and favorites functionality
- Watchlist for monitoring specific items

### Data Structures
```ruby
# Enhanced listing response format
{
  items: [],           # List of resources
  pagination: {        # Pagination metadata
    page: 1,
    per_page: 20,
    total_pages: 50,
    total_count: 1000
  },
  filters: {           # Applied filters
    category: 'finance',
    license: 'cc-by',
    updated_since: '2023-01-01'
  },
  sort: {              # Current sorting
    field: 'popularity',
    direction: 'desc'
  }
}
```

## Priority: High
Target completion: Version 0.3.0
