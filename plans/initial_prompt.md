Please help implement a new Ruby gem here. Use `/Users/trex22/development/url_categorise` as an example. The Version should be 0.0.1. Here is the API documentation: @https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api . Also here is another context resource: @https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api. Create a new plan in plans/. For now the gem should only handle downloading and parsing datasets. For now only open CSV datasets into a json structure. Allow for optional parameters to specify download paths and caching paths as this gem will be used elsewhere where we want a cache download location so that the dataset does not always have to be downloaded. Create and update a README.md with relevant info and use `/Users/trex22/development/url_categorise` as an example. Also add in tests using `/Users/trex22/development/url_categorise` as an example with relevant bin/ scripts. Add in a CLAUDE.md as well. Lastly, update the plans with new plans for future development which include, CLI tool, lists, models, benchmarks etc ...

List and plan out all actions before actioning.
