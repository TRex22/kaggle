# Models Support Plan

## Overview
Add comprehensive support for Kaggle Models API, including model discovery, downloading, and management capabilities.

## Current State
- No model functionality implemented yet
- Foundation established with dataset functionality that can be extended

## Planned Features

### Phase 1: Model Discovery
- [ ] **Model Listing**: Browse available models with pagination
- [ ] **Model Search**: Search models by name, description, tags
- [ ] **Model Filtering**: Filter by framework, task type, performance metrics
- [ ] **Model Details**: Get detailed information about specific models
- [ ] **Model Versions**: List and compare different versions of models

### Phase 2: Model Downloads
- [ ] **Model Download**: Download model files and artifacts
- [ ] **Version Management**: Download specific model versions
- [ ] **Batch Downloads**: Download multiple models or versions
- [ ] **Incremental Updates**: Download only changed files
- [ ] **Download Resume**: Resume interrupted model downloads

### Phase 3: Model Metadata
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: Access model benchmarks and scores
- [ ] **Framework Details**: Model architecture and framework information
- [ ] **Usage Examples**: Access example code and documentation
- [ ] **Dependencies**: List required libraries and versions
- [ ] **License Information**: Model licensing and usage terms

### Phase 4: Model Management
- [ ] **Local Registry**: Track downloaded models locally
- [ ] **Version Tracking**: Monitor model updates and changes
- [ ] **Validation**: Verify model integrity and completeness
- [ ] **Cleanup Tools**: Remove outdated or unused models
- [ ] **Usage Analytics**: Track model usage and performance

## Technical Implementation

### New Classes
```ruby
# lib/kaggle/model.rb
class Kaggle::Model
  attr_reader :id, :name, :framework, :task_type, :version
  
  def initialize(attributes = {})
    # Model initialization
  end
  
  def download(version: 'latest', path: nil)
    # Download model files
  end
  
  def versions
    # List available versions
  end
  
  def metadata
    # Get detailed metadata
  end
end

# lib/kaggle/model_client.rb
class Kaggle::ModelClient < Kaggle::Client
  def list_models(options = {})
    # List available models
  end
  
  def get_model(model_id, version: 'latest')
    # Get specific model details
  end
  
  def download_model(model_id, options = {})
    # Download model with options
  end
end
```

### API Endpoints
```ruby
# lib/kaggle/constants.rb additions
MODEL_ENDPOINTS = {
  list: '/models/list',
  view: '/models/view',
  download: '/models/download',
  versions: '/models/versions'
}.freeze
```

### CLI Commands
```bash
# Model listing and discovery
kaggle models list
kaggle models search "text classification"
kaggle models show model-owner/model-name

# Model downloads
kaggle models download model-owner/model-name
kaggle models download model-owner/model-name --version v2.1
kaggle models download model-owner/model-name --path ./models

# Model management  
kaggle models versions model-owner/model-name
kaggle models info model-owner/model-name
kaggle models validate ./models/model-name
```

### Caching Strategy
- Cache model metadata for offline browsing
- Smart caching of large model files
- Checksum validation for cached models
- Automatic cleanup of old cached versions

### Error Handling
- Model not found errors
- Version compatibility issues
- Large file download failures
- Storage space validation
- Network interruption handling

## Integration Points

### Dataset Integration
- Link models to their training datasets
- Show dataset requirements for model usage
- Validate dataset compatibility

### Competition Integration  
- List models used in competitions
- Show competition performance metrics
- Link to winning solutions

### Benchmark Integration
- Access model performance benchmarks
- Compare models on standard datasets
- Track performance across versions

## Priority: Medium
Target completion: Version 0.4.0

## Notes
- Models API may require additional authentication scopes
- Large model files will need chunked downloading
- Consider integration with popular ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- May need specialized handling for different model formats
